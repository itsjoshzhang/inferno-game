                Your journey leads you to the very heart of Hell, a vast, frozen chamber where Lucifer himself is trapped. The fallen angel is a colossal figure, his massive form encased in ice, yet still terrifying. He is the embodiment of evil, his gaping mouth eternally devouring the greatest sinners, whose faces you cannot yet see. The sight is horrifying yet mesmerizing, the ultimate punishment for the ultimate betrayal. The air is filled with the sound of Lucifer's gnashing teeth and the muffled screams of his victims. This is the deepest point of Hell, a place of despair and hopelessness, where the weight of eternal punishment is most acutely felt.
