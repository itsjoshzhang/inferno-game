                In the heart of the forest, you stop by a tree that once was Pietro della Vigna. His branches creak as he shares his tale. Once a man of power and trust, he fell victim to envy and lies, leading to his tragic end. Pietro speaks of his despair, the unbearable pain that drove him to his fate. Yet, in his voice, there's a hint of peace, a sense of redemption found in his eternal state. His story is a powerful lesson about the dangers of despair and the importance of seeking help in dark times. You take Pietro's story as a reminder of the delicate balance between despair and hope.

                Leaving the forest behind, you enter the eighth circle, a complex structure of ten bolgias, each designed to punish a different kind of fraud. The landscape is chaotic, with bridges and cliffs separating the bolgias. In each one, you see the deceivers and schemers of the world receiving their due. Some are sunk in tar, others are lashed by demons. The air is filled with their cries and pleas, a cacophony of regret and pain. As you navigate this maze of deceit, you witness the many faces of fraud, each punishment a reflection of the sin committed. The circle is a grim reminder of the consequences of deception and the corrupting power of lies.
