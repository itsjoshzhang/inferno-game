                In the midst of the fiery tombs, you stop to listen to Farinata degli Uberti, a soul condemned to this inferno. He stands tall and proud, even in his suffering. His voice is firm as he tells his story, a tale of political strife and a challenge to the church's authority. Farinata speaks of his beliefs, his fight for what he thought was right. His words offer a new view on faith and truth, one that speaks of courage in the face of opposition. His story, while filled with pride, also carries a sense of loss, a life spent battling in a world that was not ready for his ideas.

                The path leads you to the seventh circle, a realm divided into three distinct rings, each punishing a different form of violence. The first ring is a river of boiling blood, where those who were violent against others are submerged to varying depths. The second ring is a dense, tree-filled forest where the suicidal have been turned into gnarled, thorny bushes. The third is a desert of burning sand and raining fire, punishing violence against God, nature, and art. The air is filled with the scent of burning flesh and the sound of endless suffering. This circle is a stark reminder of the many forms violence can take, each punishment a reflection of the sin.
