                Climbing along Lucifer's tail, you find a path leading upwards. The journey is treacherous, but as you ascend, you see visions in the scales of the beast. Each scale reflects a circle of Hell, a reminder of the sins and punishments you've witnessed. These visions are a mosaic of human failings and the consequences that follow. The climb becomes a journey through your own experiences in Hell, a reflection on the lessons learned and the nature of sin. With each step, you rise further from the infernal depths, driven by a newfound understanding of the human condition.

                Leaving the final circle of Hell behind, you begin a gradual ascent towards the surface. This path is unlike any other in Hell, filled with a sense of peace and introspection. As you walk, you reflect on your journey through the circles of sin, the souls you've encountered, and the lessons they've imparted. This journey has been more than a physical one. It has been a journey of the soul, a deep dive into the nature of sin and the human heart. The path upwards is a time for reflection and understanding things like morality and attaining a second chance in life. With each step, you feel a sense of self-improvement, shedding the weight of your past burdens.
