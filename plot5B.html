                As you make your way through the forest, you find a clearer path. But your journey is not without its challenges. You trip over the outstretched branches of a soul-tree, its leaves rustling as if in pain. The brief encounter is a stark reminder of the souls around you, each tree a person who once gave in to despair. The forest is a place of sorrow, but also a lesson in the consequences of our choices and the importance of facing life's struggles with courage.

                Leaving the forest behind, you enter the eighth circle, a complex structure of ten bolgias, each designed to punish a different kind of fraud. The landscape is chaotic, with bridges and cliffs separating the bolgias. In each one, you see the deceivers and schemers of the world receiving their due. Some are sunk in tar, others are lashed by demons. The air is filled with their cries and pleas, a cacophony of regret and pain. As you navigate this maze of deceit, you witness the many faces of fraud, each punishment a reflection of the sin committed. The circle is a grim reminder of the consequences of deception and the corrupting power of lies.
