                In one of the bolgias, you encounter Charles Ponzi, the infamous schemer. Trapped and tormented, he recounts his tale. He speaks of his grand deception, how he lured people with the promise of wealth, only to betray their trust. His words are a mix of regret and a strange pride in his cunning. From Ponzi, you learn a harsh lesson about the allure and danger of deception. His story is a testament to the destructive power of greed and the inevitable downfall that follows a life built on lies. As you leave him to his fate, his warnings about the seductive nature of deceit echo in your mind.

                Your path leads you to the ninth and final circle of Hell, a vast, frozen expanse where traitors are encased in ice. This is the realm of ultimate betrayal, where the most treacherous souls are condemned to an eternity in the frigid lake. The ice stretches out before you, filled with distorted faces, their expressions locked in eternal agony. The air is bitingly cold, the silence broken only by the occasional crack of the ice and the muffled cries of the damned. As you walk among these frozen figures, the reality of their betrayal and the severity of their punishment becomes clear. This circle is a chilling reminder of what awaits those who betray trust.
