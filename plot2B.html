                You find a hidden path, a narrow passage that winds its way into the city. The walls around you seem to whisper, their voices a ghostly murmur in the dim light. They speak of sin, of choices made and paths taken. The whispers tell tales of pride, ambition, and defiance, painting a picture of humanity's complex relationship with sin. As you move through the passage, the whispers grow fainter, but their message lingers in your mind, a haunting reminder of the journey you've undertaken.

                The path, whether through the gate or the hidden passage, leads you to the sixth circle. Here, the air is thick with heat and the smell of smoke. Before you are rows of flaming tombs, each a prison for a heretic soul. The flames crackle and roar, a constant reminder of the church's harsh judgment. The souls within the tombs cry out, their voices filled with pain and anger. They were condemned for challenging the church, for daring to think differently. As you walk among the tombs, you see the faces of the damned, their expressions twisted in eternal agony. The sight is overwhelming, a stark portrayal of the price of defiance.
