                You stand before the demonic guardians, your voice steady as you speak. The air is tense. The demons, with their fiery eyes and twisted forms, listen with a mocking sneer. Their words are a blend of threats and dark wisdom. They speak of sin, not just as deeds but as a part of the soul. You listen, your resolve hardening. Their words are harsh, but through them, you begin to understand the complex nature of sin and its roots in desire and rebellion. The demons, perhaps amused or impressed by your bravery, step aside, granting you passage into the city.

                The path, whether through the gate or the hidden passage, leads you to the sixth circle. Here, the air is thick with heat and the smell of smoke. Before you are rows of flaming tombs, each a prison for a heretic soul. The flames crackle and roar, a constant reminder of the church's harsh judgment. The souls within the tombs cry out, their voices filled with pain and anger. They were condemned for challenging the church, for daring to think differently. As you walk among the tombs, you see the faces of the damned, their expressions twisted in eternal agony. The sight is overwhelming, a stark portrayal of the price of defiance.
