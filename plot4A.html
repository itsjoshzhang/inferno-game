                At the river's edge, you pause to talk with a soul half-submerged in the boiling blood. Benito Mussolini's face, twisted in pain, tells a story of violence committed in life. He speaks of battles fought, enemies defeated, and the power he wielded. But now, he laments his actions, understanding too late the true cost of his violence. His words are a warning, a grim reminder that the harm we inflict on others can lead to our own downfall. As you listen, his story etches itself into your memory, a lesson on the consequences of unchecked aggression and the importance of compassion.

                Moving deeper into Hell, you enter a dense, thorny forest. This is the Wood of the Suicidal, where the souls of those who took their own lives are transformed into gnarled, twisted trees. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and the sound of soft moans. The trees around you are eerily human, their branches like arms reaching out in silent agony. As you walk among them, the tragic fate of these souls weighs heavily on your heart. Each tree represents a story of despair and loss, a life ended by its own hand. The forest is a somber place, a stark reminder of the pain and hopelessness that can consume the human soul.
