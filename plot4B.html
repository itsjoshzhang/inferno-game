His tale is one of regret but also of enduring dignity, a reminder that even in suffering, the human spirit can remain unbroken. His words leave a lasting impact, teaching you about the strength of character and the value of intellectual pursuit.

                Moving deeper into Hell, you enter a dense, thorny forest. This is the Wood of the Suicidal, where the souls of those who took their own lives are transformed into gnarled, twisted trees. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and the sound of soft moans. The trees around you are eerily human, their branches like arms reaching out in silent agony. As you walk among them, the tragic fate of these souls weighs heavily on your heart. Each tree represents a story of despair and loss, a life ended by its own hand. The forest is a somber place, a stark reminder of the pain and hopelessness that can consume the human soul.
