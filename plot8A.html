                Held in between Lucifer's teeth, you confront Josef Mengele and Shiro Ishii, two souls who committed unspeakable atrocities in life. They stand as chilling examples of how far humans can go in their quest to manipulate and control nature. Their experiments on humans, devoid of morality and compassion, represented a profound evil. As you speak with them, their justifications fall flat, their words hollow against the backdrop of their actions. This encounter is a stark reminder of the depths of human cruelty. Their stories reinforce the necessity of standing against such evil.

                Leaving the final circle of Hell behind, you begin a gradual ascent towards the surface. This path is unlike any other in Hell, filled with a sense of peace and introspection. As you walk, you reflect on your journey through the circles of sin, the souls you've encountered, and the lessons they've imparted. This journey has been more than a physical one. It has been a journey of the soul, a deep dive into the nature of sin and the human heart. The path upwards is a time for reflection and understanding things like morality and attaining a second chance in life. With each step, you feel a sense of self-improvement, shedding the weight of your past burdens.
