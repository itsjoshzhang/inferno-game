                The City of Dis rises before you, a formidable sight with its towering iron walls that seem to scrape the darkened skies. The air around you is heavy, filled with an ominous sense of foreboding. Flames sporadically dance along the wall's surface, casting long, sinister shadows that flicker across the barren ground. This city, encircling the lower circles of Hell, stands as a fortress of despair and power. It's a place few have seen and even fewer have dared to enter. The very sight of it sends a shiver down your spine, yet you know there's no turning back now.

                Your journey thus far has been one of both terror and enlightenment, leading you through the upper circles of Hell, each step a testament to your unwavering spirit. Now, as you stand before the daunting gates of Dis, you feel the weight of your journey. The gates loom large, an iron barrier to the unknown horrors that lie beyond. Faint, sorrowful cries drift from within the city, a haunting reminder of the suffering that awaits. Despite the fear that grips your heart, a resolve stirs within you. This is the path you must take, the next chapter in your journey through the depths of the inferno. With a steadying breath, you prepare to make your next move.
