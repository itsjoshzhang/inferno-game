                You move quickly through the circle of the heretics, the heat of the flaming tombs pressing against your skin. As you walk, the cries and pleas of the damned fill the air. Each voice tells a different story of sin, a personal tale of defiance against the divine order. These cries paint a vivid picture of humanity's struggle with faith, each soul a reminder of the consequences of challenging established beliefs. Their words, filled with regret and sorrow, echo in your mind as you leave the circle behind, a chorus of lost souls still searching for redemption.

                The path leads you to the seventh circle, a realm divided into three distinct rings, each punishing a different form of violence. The first ring is a river of boiling blood, where those who were violent against others are submerged to varying depths. The second ring is a dense, tree-filled forest where the suicidal have been turned into gnarled, thorny bushes. The third is a desert of burning sand and raining fire, punishing violence against God, nature, and art. The air is filled with the scent of burning flesh and the sound of endless suffering. This circle is a stark reminder of the many forms violence can take, each punishment a reflection of the sin.
